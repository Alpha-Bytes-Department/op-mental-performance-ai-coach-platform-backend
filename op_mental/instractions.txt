in this history you can see first we can see the welcome message and question. then i have to give answer for the "question": "What internal challenge would you like to work through today? Please share what's on your mind:",
so give it in post request but in history it is not showing . when i give the question answer in post request like "i am facing mental depression" then i get the history and get a new response and user meassage as you can see in hitory 
so why this problem happne . i really want to show in history like that the ai response and user message for every conversation but do not repied it in history
