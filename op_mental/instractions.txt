in my journaling app when i hit the create journal
{
   "message": "1"
}

the response is 
{
    "reply": "Wins are easy to overlook. Let's dive into your success. Tell me about a recent personal achievement or positive experience you'd like to explore deeper.",
    "session_id": 11
}

then when i give reply with session_id
{
    "session_id": "11",
    "message":"Sure! I set aside 20 minutes every morning, used guided meditation audio, and kept a small journal to note how I felt before and after each session. This helped me stay consistent and track my progress."
}
then the response is 
{
    "reply": "Invalid choice. Please select 1, 2, 3, or 4.",
    "session_id": "11"
}
